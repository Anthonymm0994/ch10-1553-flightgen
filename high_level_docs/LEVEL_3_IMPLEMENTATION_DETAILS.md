# Level 3: Implementation Details
## CH10 Generator - Complete Technical Description

### The Problem Space

#### Flight Test Data Challenges

Flight testing generates massive amounts of data that must be recorded, processed, and analyzed. The data comes from hundreds of sensors and avionics systems, all operating at different rates and using different encoding schemes. Test engineers need this data in standardized formats for analysis, but obtaining real flight data involves:

- Operating actual aircraft with full instrumentation
- Risk to equipment and personnel during test maneuvers
- Limited ability to repeat exact conditions
- High operational costs for each test flight
- Long lead times for test preparation

The CH10 Generator addresses these challenges by creating synthetic data that matches what real systems produce, allowing development and testing of analysis tools without actual flight operations.

**What This Means for Users:**
- **Immediate Testing**: Systems can be validated today, not after flight scheduling
- **Risk-Free Development**: Edge cases and failure modes can be tested safely
- **Cost Control**: Development and validation can proceed without expensive flight hours
- **Repeatable Scenarios**: Identical test conditions can be created for consistent validation
- **Standards Compliance**: Tools can be ensured to work with industry-standard formats

### MIL-STD-1553 Protocol Details

#### Message Structure

The 1553 protocol uses a command/response architecture where a Bus Controller (BC) orchestrates all communication with Remote Terminals (RTs). Each message transaction consists of three parts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BC as Bus Controller
    participant RT as Remote Terminal
    
    BC->>RT: Command Word
    Note over RT: Process Command
    RT->>BC: Status Word
    RT->>BC: Data Words (1-32)
```

#### Word Formats

Each 16-bit word in 1553 has specific bit allocations:

**Command Word Structure**:
- Bits 0-4: Word Count or Mode Code
- Bits 5-9: Subaddress
- Bit 10: Transmit/Receive bit
- Bits 11-15: RT Address

**Status Word Structure**:
- Bits 0-4: Reserved
- Bit 5: Instrumentation bit
- Bit 6: Service Request
- Bit 7: Reserved
- Bit 8: Broadcast Command Received
- Bit 9: Busy
- Bit 10: Subsystem Flag
- Bit 11: Dynamic Bus Control Acceptance
- Bit 12: Terminal Flag
- Bits 13-15: RT Address echo

#### Special Addresses and Modes

The 1553 standard defines special addresses with specific meanings:
- RT Address 31: Broadcast address (all RTs receive)
- Subaddress 0: Mode code commands
- Subaddress 31: Mode code commands
- Word Count 0: Actually means 32 words (historical convention)

### Data Encoding Methods

#### Binary Number Representation (BNR)

BNR encoding represents fractional numbers in fixed-point format. The encoding process involves:

1. **Range determination**: Define the minimum and maximum values
2. **Scaling calculation**: Determine bits needed for required resolution
3. **Value conversion**: Scale the floating-point value to integer range
4. **Two's complement**: Handle negative values using two's complement

For angles, BNR typically uses:
- Full 16 bits for 360-degree range
- Resolution of 360/65536 = 0.0055 degrees per bit
- Automatic wraparound for values outside -180 to +180

#### Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

BCD encoding stores each decimal digit in 4 bits:
- Each nibble (4 bits) represents one decimal digit (0-9)
- 16-bit word can store 4 decimal digits
- Used for frequencies, identifiers, and display values
- No arithmetic operations performed on BCD values

#### Float32 Split Encoding

IEEE 754 single-precision floats are split across two 16-bit words:
- First word: Sign bit, exponent, and upper mantissa
- Second word: Lower mantissa bits
- Maintains full 32-bit precision
- Used for high-precision measurements like GPS coordinates

### Bitfield Packing Support

#### Standard Practice

Bitfield packing is a common technique used in Interface Control Documents (ICDs) to efficiently utilize 16-bit word space. The system implements this standard approach to support ICD specifications.

**Example**: A 16-bit word can contain multiple fields as specified in the ICD:
- **Bits 0-2**: Status value (3 bits)
- **Bits 3-7**: Counter value (5 bits)
- **Bits 8-15**: Main data value (8 bits)

#### Validation Rules

The system enforces standard validation rules for bitfield packing:

1. **Bit allocation**: Total bits used cannot exceed 16
2. **Overlap prevention**: No two fields can use the same bit positions
3. **Value range**: Values must fit within allocated bits
4. **Alignment**: Fields must align on bit boundaries
5. **Encoding restrictions**: BNR and float32_split cannot use bitfields

### Flight Dynamics Simulation

#### Physics Model

The flight simulator implements a simplified 6-degree-of-freedom model:

**Translational dynamics**:
- Forward/backward motion (X-axis)
- Left/right motion (Y-axis)  
- Up/down motion (Z-axis)

**Rotational dynamics**:
- Pitch (rotation about Y-axis)
- Roll (rotation about X-axis)
- Yaw (rotation about Z-axis)

#### Sensor Modeling

Each sensor type has characteristic errors and noise:

**GPS Sensors**:
- Position noise: Gaussian distribution, 1-3 meter standard deviation
- Update rate: Typically 1-10 Hz
- Occasional dropouts during maneuvers

**Inertial Navigation System (INS)**:
- Drift accumulation over time
- Higher accuracy than GPS short-term
- Requires periodic GPS updates for correction

**Air Data Sensors**:
- Altitude: Pressure-based with temperature compensation
- Airspeed: Pitot-static system simulation
- Angle of attack: Vane position with aerodynamic effects

### Message Scheduling Algorithm

#### Frame Structure

The scheduling system organizes messages into a hierarchical frame structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Scheduling Hierarchy"
        MJF[Major Frame<br/>1 second]
        MJF --> MNF1[Minor Frame 1<br/>20ms]
        MJF --> MNF2[Minor Frame 2<br/>20ms]
        MJF --> MNF50[Minor Frame 50<br/>20ms]
        
        MNF1 --> MSG1[Message Slots]
        MNF2 --> MSG2[Message Slots]
        MNF50 --> MSG50[Message Slots]
    end
```

#### Rate Monotonic Scheduling

Messages are scheduled using rate monotonic principles:
- Higher frequency messages get higher priority
- Messages scheduled at their exact rate when possible
- Lower priority messages fill remaining slots
- Bus utilization monitored to prevent overload

#### Timing Precision

The system maintains microsecond-level timing precision:
- Each message has an exact transmission time
- Gap times between messages are calculated
- Jitter can be added to simulate real-world variations
- Time synchronization maintained throughout file

### IRIG-106 Chapter 10 Format

#### File Structure

CH10 files follow a specific structure:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "CH10 File Layout"
        H[File Header] --> T1[TMATS]
        T1 --> TP1[Time Packet]
        TP1 --> D1[Data Packet 1]
        D1 --> D2[Data Packet 2]
        D2 --> TP2[Time Packet]
        TP2 --> D3[Data Packet 3]
        D3 --> DN[...]
    end
```

#### Packet Headers

Each packet contains a standard header with:
- Sync pattern (0xEB25) for packet boundary detection
- Channel ID identifying the data source
- Packet length in bytes
- Data length (payload size)
- Timestamp in IRIG format
- Sequence number for ordering
- Data type identifier

#### TMATS Structure

TMATS (Telemetry Attributes Transfer Standard) uses a hierarchical key-value format:
- G-group: General information about the recording
- B-group: Bus/channel information
- M-group: Message definitions
- R-group: Recording specific data

Each entry follows the pattern: GROUP\KEY:VALUE;

### Validation Framework

#### Multi-Stage Validation

The validation process occurs at multiple stages:

```mermaid
graph TD
    IV[Input Validation] --> GV[Generation Validation]
    GV --> OV[Output Validation]
    OV --> EV[External Validation]
    
    IV --> |Check| ICD[ICD Structure]
    IV --> |Check| SC[Scenario Format]
    
    GV --> |Check| MSG[Message Rates]
    GV --> |Check| TIM[Timing Accuracy]
    
    OV --> |Check| FMT[File Format]
    OV --> |Check| CHK[Checksums]
    
    EV --> |Use| TSH[TShark]
    EV --> |Use| PY[PyChapter10]
```

#### Error Detection

The system detects various error conditions:
- **Format errors**: Invalid packet structure, bad sync patterns
- **Timing errors**: Messages outside expected windows
- **Data errors**: Values outside valid ranges
- **Protocol errors**: Invalid RT/SA combinations
- **Encoding errors**: Values that don't fit specified encoding

### Performance Optimization

#### Memory Management
